# UnderstandingBikability
Code to compute, visualise and analyse bikeability curves of an urban network

We provide a working example of the code used to implement a multi-criteria network assessment methodology of urban bicycle networks. This code is the implementation of the methodology described in the article (under review): 'Understanding Bikeability: a methodology to assess urban networks' Authors: Giulia Reggiani, Tim van Oijen, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam, Winnie Daamen, Hai Lee Vu, and Serge Hoogendoorn. 

Files: 
1) python notebook with executable code 
2) Amsterdam coarse-grained network at postal code zones 
3) csv file with long. lat. coordinates of all nodes included in flie (2) 
4) requirements.txt needed for running the notebook on MyBinder

The repository can be run with MyBinder under the following URL's:
