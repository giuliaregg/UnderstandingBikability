# UnderstandingBikability
Code to compute, visualise and analyse bikeability curves of an urban network

We provide a working example of the code used to implement a multi-criteria network assessment methodology of urban bicycle networks. This code is the implementation of the methodology described in the article: 'Understanding Bikeability: a methodology to assess urban networks' Authors: Giulia Reggiani, Tim van Oijen, Homayoun Hamedmoghadam, Winnie Daamen, Hai Lee Vu, and Serge Hoogendoorn.
